# Session Summary - 2026-01-28 12:01

## 📋 Overview
In this session, we focused on improving the development workflow and configuring the environment. We identified commands for running the backend, frontend, and Cloudflare tunnel. We also created a set of scripts to easily switch the Claude Code configuration between the standard "Pro/Max Plan" and a custom "Z AI API" mode.

## ✅ Completed Features
1. **Cloudflare Tunnel Command**: Identified and provided the correct command to start the tunnel manually (`cloudflared.exe tunnel --url http://localhost:3000`).
2. **Dev Server Commands**: Identified commands to start Backend and Frontend servers.
3. **Claude Code Mode Switcher**:
   - Created `scripts/switch_claude_mode.ps1`: A PowerShell script to modify `.claude/settings.local.json`. It can inject custom API settings (Z AI) or revert to default (Pro/Max), preserving other configurations like permissions.
   - Created `switch_mode.bat`: A convenient batch wrapper in the root directory to execute the switch via `switch_mode zai` or `switch_mode pro`.

## 📂 Files Modified/Created
- `scripts/switch_claude_mode.ps1` [NEW] - PowerShell logic for JSON manipulation.
- `switch_mode.bat` [NEW] - Root level wrapper script.
- `.claude/settings.local.json` [READ/WRITE] - Target configuration file (verified path).

## 🐛 Issues Encountered & Solutions
- **Locating Settings File**: Initially couldn't find `settings.local.json` in the root. Found it in the `.claude` hidden directory (`d:\02 genAI\hr-ims\.claude\settings.local.json`).
- **Missing API Config**: I did not have the actual Z AI API URL or keys.
  - **Solution**: Created the script with **placeholder values** and added a clear instruction for the user to edit the file (`scripts/switch_claude_mode.ps1`) with their actual credentials.

## ⏳ Pending Tasks
- [ ] **Action Required**: User needs to edit `d:\02 genAI\hr-ims\scripts\switch_claude_mode.ps1` to replace the placeholder URL and Model name with real Z AI values.

## 🎯 Next Steps
1. User updates variables in `scripts/switch_claude_mode.ps1`.
2. Test the switch command: `switch_mode zai`.
3. Verify `.claude/settings.local.json` contains the correct API base URL.

## 💡 Notes for Next Session
- The `switch_mode.bat` script requires PowerShell to run.
- Ensure the `.claude/settings.local.json` file remains writable and is not locked by other processes when switching.
